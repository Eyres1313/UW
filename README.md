Possible issues – 
•	Me mixing up the reading/writing file structure
•	I think I had the wrong import statement to begin with – this is the one I require
const fs = require("fs").promises;
Thank you for discussing with me the require – this is something I had not used before 
•	I am not used to using require and I got confused with type module – but it was actually pretty cool to learn something new! 
•	File structures are something I am still getting my head around 

First check if I can console log the dummy invoice – server running fine.
